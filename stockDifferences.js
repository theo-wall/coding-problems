// You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal
// is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a
// stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. For example
// if the input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return
// 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16
// was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could
// have been made, return -1.

const numbers = [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11];

  return stockPrices;
